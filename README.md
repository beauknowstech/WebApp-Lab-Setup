# WebApp-Lab-Setup

as always, look under the hood before you run a script from the internet

If docker is not installed yet, you will have to run the script twice. 


wget https://github.com/beauknowstech/WebApp-Lab-Setup/raw/master/WebApp-Lab-Setup.sh


chmod +x WebApp-Lab-Setup.sh


./WebApp-Lab-Setup.sh
